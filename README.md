  Seq_o_matics is a single platform for chemistry exchange, scope controls and image analysis.This system is a fully integrated solution that combines three key components. It incorporates a fluidics exchange system, which manages the flow and regulation of fluids within the setup. This is complemented by a scope control system, allowing for precise manipulation and adjustment of the viewing apparatus. Additionally, the system features a preliminary image analysis capability, which processes and interprets visual data in its initial stages. Together, these elements work in harmony to create a comprehensive and efficient integrated system.
